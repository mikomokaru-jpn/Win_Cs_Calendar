### Techniques
User interfaces such as forms and controls were created programmatically without using the designer of Visual Stadio. Calculate dates using DateTime class. Draw figures with Graphics class. Implement event handlers for mouse events and keystroke events. Create a subclass of Control class and realize the feature equivalent to Button class. Embed a JSON format file in the resource and read it at runtime.
